# 📸 Shots by Ilan – Photography Portfolio Website

**Live Site:** shotsbyilan.com

## 🖥️ Overview
**Shots by Ilan** is a modern photography portfolio website I designed and developed for a photographer.

I was hired to build the full website from scratch, handling everything from layout design and responsive styling to deployment and custom domain setup. The final result is a professional .com site that serves as a personal brand hub for the photographer.
